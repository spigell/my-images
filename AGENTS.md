# Repository Guidelines

- When updating the Codex version, ensure that every reference in `openai-codex/` (Dockerfiles, README, docker-compose) and the `.github/workflows/openai-codex-publish.yaml` workflow are kept in sync.
- Document any version bumps or related workflow updates in the PR summary.
